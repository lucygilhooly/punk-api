PUNK API

Here I have created an application which utilises a beers API.

This app allows you to browse the beers just by their name, percentage, description and image (as is displayed on each card), or you can use the search bar functionality to search for a beer by its name.

I have added some basic tests to ensure the user is able to see the card components rendered on the page correctly.

Something I struggled with when designing this application was gaining a full grasp of the parent child relationship and which file to perform certain functions in, I managed to over come this in regard to the search bar and if I am to further develop this application I hope to add filter functionality so beers can be searched for by their percentage rather than just their name.

Something I am proud of is the responsiveness of the app, it is fully adaptable to mobile and to desktop computers.
